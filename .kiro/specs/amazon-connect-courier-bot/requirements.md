# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive Amazon Connect-based voicebot solution for courier services. The system will integrate with an existing Amazon Connect instance and provide a complete admin interface for managing the voicebot infrastructure. The solution includes automated provisioning of AWS resources (Lex bot, Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables), contact flow creation, and a FastAPI-based admin application for step-by-step management.

The voicebot will handle three primary customer interactions: booking courier services, tracking delivery status, and collecting complaints/feedback on completed deliveries. All data will be stored in DynamoDB with serverless architecture throughout.
